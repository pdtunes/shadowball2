                      much as 266% within four weeks.</b></p>

                  <p> <i> The ShadowBall Academy offers the worlds leading ball skills development program for players
                      aged 7 to 13. </i> </p>

                  <p> <i> The ShadowBall Academy is an innovative rugby venue offering rugby development programmes that
                      augment regular coaching to massively improve individual ball skills. </i> </p>

                  <p> Founded on the revolutionary rugby training tool – the ShadowBall, players now have the
                    opportunity to take their skills to the next level. </p>

                  <p> A world first in rugby skills development that has been proven and tested at the highest levels of
                    the game! </p>
                  <br><br>



                  <p> Dear Rugby Parent </p>

                  <p> <b> The ShadowBall Academy can redefine your child’s rugby passing game. </b> </p>



                  <p> Excellent passing and catching skills are fundamental to the modern game. For young players, it is
                    crucial to master skills individually and not only as a team. </p>

                  <p> From school level to professional rugby, it has been proven that the more practice and attention a
                    player gives to developing his/her passing and catching skills, the more advanced and confident
                    sports people they will become. </p>

                  <p> With a ShadowBall, dedication and some determination, future champions can get the edge on their
                    competition by improving their skills. </p>

                  <br><br>



                  <p> <b> WHAT IS A SHADOWBALL? </b> </p>

                  <p> <i> The patented rugby-training ball, exclusively supplied by ShadowBall that rebounds off any
                      wall and comes spiralling back to the passer. </i></p>

                  <p> The ShadowBall enables players to practice and perfect their rugby passes and catches in their own
                    time. </p>

                  <p> Hand stitched, technically balanced and made from natural rubber which can withstand 100’s of
                    thousands of repetitions against the wall. </p>

                  <p> Made to meet World Rugby specifications for match ball weight and circumference, the ShadowBall
                    simulates training with a regular match ball.</p>

                  <p> <i> “the greatest innovation in Rugby since the kicking tee replaced the bucket of sand” by
                      PlanetRugby.com </i> </p>




                  <p> The ShadowBall allows players to do as many as 300 passes and catches in just 10 minutes in a solo
                    or coach led training session <b> <i> “Repetition is the mother of skill”.</i> </b> </p>

                    bad habits can make those habits permanent too. </p>

                    maximise the success of the program by guiding players through the process beginning to end. </p>
