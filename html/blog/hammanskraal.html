        <h1>Hammanskraal, Touch Rugby & The Hami Town Sporting Company</h1>

        <p>Makgatle Primary School has been named the champion in the 2019 ShadowBall Touch Rugby League – a local
          initiative to develop grassroots rugby at under-resourced schools in Hammanskraal.</p>
        <img src="/shadowball2/img/blog/3.png" alt="img3">

        <p> <i>
            In partnership with Marstercard, Worldwide Partner of Rugby World Cup 2019TM, and Pick n Pay, 1200 girls and
            boys from 12 local primary schools were selected to join an eight-week touch rugby programme. </i></p>

        <img src="/shadowball2/img/blog/6.jpg" alt="img6">

        <p>The ShadowBall Pass Booster programme – in association with the Hamaanskraal Sports Company, Touch Rugby
          South Africa and Gauteng Touch Rugby Association – not only teaches physical skills such as passing and
          catching and hand-eye co-ordination, but also helps learners master other life skills such as teamwork,
          respect, and discipline through the experience they gain on the field. </p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6cjCJXLZSek" frameborder="0"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <p>During August and September, each school received training kits and four weekly training sessions by two
          local coaches trained by ShadowBall. A team from each school was then selected to compete at the ShadowBall
          Touch Rugby tournament held at the Hammanskraal Sports Complex on 19 October 2019. Playing for school honour
          and glory, the children put their newly learnt skills to the test, with Makgatle Primary School emerging as
          the winner against St Athanacias. </p>

        <p>Ashraf Dawood, Deputy Chief Education Specialist: Policy and Planning at the Gauteng Department of Education
          in Tshwane-North District, says: “All of our schools in Hammanskraal are non-feepaying schools – they lack
          facilities and equipment. The learners love and excel in sports, but with no proper fields or equipment, their
          talent is not explored. Mastercard, ShadowBall and Pick n Pay have given us hope by exposing our learners to
          an exciting form of rugby.”</p>

        <p>“Touch rugby is a truly inclusive sport as it can be played by everybody. It doesn’t matter if you are a girl
          or boy, if you are tall or short or what background you come from,” says Gary Crookes, ShadowBall Founder and
          Managing Director. “This programme has helped the youth in Hammanskraal learn physical skills, gain confidence
          and make new friends. We believe communities that play sport together are healthier and happier.”</p>


        <p>The Hammanskraal Sporting Company has been trained to deliver the ShadowBall Pass Booster Programme as part
          of a long-term sport community development project. </p>

        <p>The ShadowBall Touch Rugby League is one of several community initiatives supported by Mastercard and Pick n
          Pay, following the rollout out of Mastercard’s Start Something Priceless Rugby World Cup 2019TM campaign
          earlier this year. During the campaign, Mastercard committed to donate funds towards schools’ sports
          development for each purchase that shoppers made using their Mastercard contactless card at Pick n Pay. </p>

        <p>“Rugby is a passion that unites people and what better way to Start Something Priceless than by giving South
          Africans the opportunity to come together for children who have so much potential but are held back by a lack
          of resources,” says Beatrice Cornacchia, Senior Vice-President of Marketing and Communications: Middle East
          and Africa at Mastercard. “Together with our partners, we are honoured to give these youths the platform to
          pursue their passion for sport and help them reach their full potential.” </p>

        <p>The 12 schools form part of Pick n Pay’s School Club programme – an education initiative that not only
          provides free educational material to over 3 300 schools in the country, but a platform that encourages a
          healthy and active lifestyle. “We believe in educating our future learners and initiatives like this help
          young learners become heroes both in and outside the classroom,” says Andre Nel, Pick n Pay’s General Manager
          for Sustainability.</p>
